# Andrei's Engineering Project MVP

My project goal is to create a web app that predicts an NBA's market value based on their current in-season stats.

So far, I have managed to:

* Scrape basketball-reference and hoopshype for previous years data (used for training my model)
* Train my model and save model parameters 
* Scrape basketball-reference to update the current stats

I still need to:

* Convert my CSV tables to SQL databases in order to satisfy one of the project criteria
* Create a streamlit app
* Deploy the streamlit app online (to heroku or streamlit.io?  suggestions welcome)
* Use apache airflow or cron to schedule daily updates
